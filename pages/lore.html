      Viktor was born in Zaun, a city-state in Runeterra known for its
      technological advancements and industry. He was a brilliant inventor who
      dreamed of creating a perfect machine that could elevate humanity to a
      higher form of life.As Viktor's obsession with his creations grew, he
      began to experiment with merging flesh and machine, leading him down a
      dark path. He eventually replaced most of his body with machines and
      became one of the most powerful machine mages in Runeterra.
