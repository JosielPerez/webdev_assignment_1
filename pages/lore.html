      Viktor was born in Zaun, a city-state in Runeterra known for its
      technological advancements and industry. He was a brilliant inventor who
      dreamed of creating a perfect machine that could elevate humanity to a
      higher form of life.As Viktor's obsession with his creations grew, he
      began to experiment with merging flesh and machine, leading him down a
      dark path. He eventually replaced most of his body with machines and
      became one of the most powerful machine mages in Runeterra.

    <p class="paragraph">
      Viktor's ultimate goal is to create a technological utopia where humans
      can evolve and transcend their current limitations. He believes that
      machines are the key to unlocking humanity's full potential, and that
      anyone who opposes his vision is simply holding humanity back. Viktor's
      approach to achieving his goal is ruthless and unforgiving. He sees his
      fellow Zaunites as weak and misguided, and he is not above using force to
      achieve his ends. His creations, including the monstrous Battlecast and
      the self-aware Glorious Evolution, are designed to further his ultimate
      goal at any cost.
